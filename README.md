## Workshop Goals

This two-hour introductory workshop will teach you MaxQDA from scratch with
clear introductions, concise examples, and support documents. You will learn how

how to use manual and autocode features. We will review some of the additional
analytic features including visual, memo and the Questions, Themes and Theories

Instructors will share recommended resources.
