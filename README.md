## Workshop Goals

This two-hour introductory workshop will teach you MaxQDA from scratch with
clear introductions, concise examples, and support documents. You will learn how
to download and install the MaxQDA software, upload multiple forms of data then
how to use manual and autocode features. We will review some of the additional
analytic features including visual, memo and the Questions, Themes and Theories
(QTT) tools. We will briefly touch on the MaxQDA Team cloud-based version.
Instructors will share recommended resources.
